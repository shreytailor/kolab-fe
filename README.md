## Project Brief
Kolab is a collaboration platform for students where they can anonymously ask questions to their peers. It follows a forum based approach as one is able to post, and also leave followups.

The application is powered by React in the frontend, Node.js in the backend, and MySQL database is used to store everything relating to the forum data.

On a platform where you can maintain anonymity, good security is essential. Therefore, students must use Google authorization to gain access into their portal.
